Howto use "dependency"

 Dependency is a little library based on ASM to gather class dependency
 information. So can easily extract what classes are a single class or
 a whole jar requires at to load. (It does not take reflection into account
 though)

+--------------------
Set dependencies = DependencyUtils.getDependenciesOfClass(SomeClass.class);
Set dependencies = DependencyUtils.getDependenciesOfJar(jarInputStream);
+--------------------

 You can find out what classes are missing from a classpath, what the
 transitive dependencies are of a class or jar and what classes are
 not required.

+--------------------
Clazzpath clazzpath = new Clazzpath();
ClazzpathUnit jar = new ClazzpathUnit(clazzpath, new File("my.jar"));
new ClazzpathUnit(clazzpath, new File("depA.jar"));
new ClazzpathUnit(clazzpath, new File("depB.jar"));

Set allClazzes = clazzpath.getClazzes();
Set missing = clazzpath.getMissingClazzes();
Set jarClazzes = jar.getClazzes();
Set jarDependencies = jar.getDependencies();
Set jarTransitiveDependencies = jar.getTransitiveDependencies();

Collection remove = new ArrayList();
remove.addAll( allClazzes );
remove.removeAll( jarClazzes );
remove.removeAll( jarTransitiveDependencies );

// remove holds all classes that can be removed
+--------------------

 This libraries basically provides the core of the maven2 minijar
 plugin that does something in between jarjar and proguard - just
 on the class level. While proguard is more sophisticated in it's
 analysis it's also more complex. The minijar plugin is KISS (keep
 it simple and stupid) approach that still provides a good "compression"
 ratio if you want to shrink your jar to only the classes you need.
 With the dependency library you can also easily inline dependencies
 by renaming classes and while adjusting the references.

+--------------------
ClassWriter writer = new ClassWriter(true, false);

new ClassReader(cl.getResourceAsStream("java/util/HashMap.class")).accept(
  new RenamingVisitor(writer), new ResourceRenamer() {
    public String getNewNameFor(final String oldName) {
      if (oldName.startsWith("java.util.HashMap")) {
        return "my." + oldName;
      }
    return oldName;
}}), false);
+--------------------

 Using the JarUtils it's easy to filer and rename and create
 a single jar that only includes what you define and with the
 name you provide.

+--------------------
JarUtils.combineJars(
 new File[] { new File("a.jar"), new File("b.jar") },
 new ResourceMatcher[] { }
 new ResourceMatcher[] { }
 new ResourceRenamer[] { },
 new File("output.jar")
);
